''' 

Depict game we want to play as a black box. It has a given state, you give it an action and it returns you a reward that depends on both the action and the state. The state changes and you repeat until the game ends (terminal state).

Idea is that the network predicts the Q-value of each action given a state. The Q-value is a sort of value/utility of the action (a) given the state (s):
    Q(s, a) = Sum_t y^t * r_t = r(s, a) + y * max_a'{Q(s', a')}
where r(s, a) is the immediate reward of action a in state s (Bellman equation).

We can thus pick actions by running the network on a given state and choosing the action with highest Q(s, a).

While playing game, we update the training examples and retrain the network to optimise the prediction. We add some random behaviour in order to allow the player to 'explore' the game (otherwise it repeats the actions it thinks are optimal over and over and can get stuck in a local minimum). The idea is that this iteration should make the network's estimate of Q(s, a) near the true Q(s, a).

Steps for running the learning. 
1. Initialise the class instances, including the neural network (input: dim(state space), output: dim(action space));
2. Run game. At each turn:
   a) Run a lottery to see if action will be random or if it will be based on running the network with current weights and choosing action with greatest output (Q-value);
   b) Store old state, action, reward and new state (inc. if it crashed) into the memory: (s, a, r, s', c);
   c) Train network on a single training example generated by:
       - running network on s' (store that) and on s;
       - updating result from running on s corresponding to action a to be r + y * max_a'{Q(s', a')}, store this new result as y
       - train network on single example (x = s, y = y)
3. Train network on larger sample of memory:
   a) Extract batch from memory
   b) Rowwise on memory batch, do the first two steps described in 2c above  to generate a larger training sample
   c) Train network on this sample
4. Go back to step 2. Run game again a set number of times to allow network to learn.

Add in:
 - lottery that decides if move is random or not starts off always giving random and slowly gives less and less
 - variable (slowing) learning rate
